# Bugs and Issues Found

## Critical Security Issues

### 1. Missing Authorization Checks (P0)
- **Location**: `app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb`
- **Issue**: No authorization checks to verify user permissions for task operations
- **Impact**: Users could potentially access/modify tasks they shouldn't have access to
- **Fix**: Implement proper authorization using a gem like Pundit or CanCanCan

### 2. Client-Side Only Permission Checking (P0)
- **Location**: `app/javascript/controllers/job_controller.js:377`
- **Issue**: Delete permissions are only checked client-side
- **Impact**: Malicious users could bypass permission checks by manipulating JavaScript
- **Fix**: Implement server-side permission checking in controllers

## Performance Issues

### 3. N+1 Queries in Sidebar (P1)
- **Location**: `app/components/sidebar/sidebar_component.rb:122-138`
- **Issue**: Multiple separate database queries for counts without proper filtering
- **Impact**: Poor performance as data grows
- **Current Problems**:
  - `my_jobs_count` doesn't filter by active status
  - `unassigned_count` doesn't filter by active status
  - `others_count` doesn't filter by active status
  - Each method makes a separate database query

### 4. Database Queries in View Components (P1)
- **Location**: Multiple view components
- **Issue**: Direct model queries in views violate MVC separation
- **Impact**: Performance issues, harder to test and cache

## Data Integrity Issues

### 5. Race Conditions in Task Reordering (P1)
- **Location**: `app/services/task_sorting_service.rb`
- **Issue**: No locking mechanism when reordering tasks
- **Impact**: Concurrent updates could corrupt task positions
- **Fix**: Implement optimistic or pessimistic locking

### 6. Missing Transaction Blocks (P2)
- **Location**: `app/controllers/jobs_controller.rb`
- **Issue**: Multiple database operations without transaction wrapping
- **Impact**: Partial updates possible if errors occur

## Code Quality Issues

### 7. Overly Large JavaScript File (P2)
- **Location**: `app/javascript/controllers/job_controller.js`
- **Issue**: 2342 lines in a single file with complex logic
- **Impact**: Hard to maintain, test, and debug

### 8. Missing Error Handling (P2)
- **Location**: Multiple controllers
- **Issue**: Using bang methods (create!, update!) without rescue blocks
- **Impact**: Unhandled exceptions could crash requests

## Test Coverage Gaps

### 9. Missing Authorization Tests (P1)
- **Issue**: No tests for authorization scenarios
- **Impact**: Security vulnerabilities could go unnoticed

### 10. Missing Error Scenario Tests (P2)
- **Issue**: Happy path tests only, no failure scenario coverage
- **Impact**: Edge cases and error conditions not properly handled

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions (P0)**:
   - Implement authorization system
   - Add server-side permission checks
   - Fix sidebar count filtering

2. **Short-term (P1)**:
   - Optimize sidebar queries with proper scopes
   - Add database indexes
   - Implement locking for concurrent operations
   - Add authorization tests

3. **Medium-term (P2)**:
   - Refactor large JavaScript files
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Move queries out of views
   - Add transaction blocks where needed
