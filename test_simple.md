# Simple Manual Test Instructions

## To test if task reordering works:

1. **Open browser** and go to: http://localhost:3000
2. **Login** with test@example.com / testpassword
3. **Navigate** to: http://localhost:3000/clients/5/jobs/21
4. **Open Developer Console** (F12) to see logs
5. **Note the current task order** - especially which tasks are at the top
6. **Click on a task's status button** (the emoji) that is NOT already "In Progress"
7. **Select "In Progress"** from the dropdown

## Expected Results:

### ✅ Immediate UI Changes:
- Status emoji changes to 🟢 immediately
- Dropdown closes immediately
- Console shows: "Updating task [ID] status to in_progress"

### ✅ Server Response:
- Console shows: "Response received: {status: 200, contentType: 'text/vnd.turbo-stream.html'...}"
- Console shows: "Processing Turbo Stream response..."
- Console shows: "Turbo Stream HTML: <turbo-stream action="update"..."
- Console shows: "Turbo Stream processed"

### ✅ Task Reordering:
- The task you changed to "In Progress" should move to the TOP of the list
- Other tasks maintain their relative order
- The reordering should happen smoothly

## Debugging:

Check Rails server logs for:
```
=== TasksController#update ===
Request format: text/vnd.turbo-stream.html
Is Turbo Stream?: true
=== render_task_list_update called ===
Tasks tree has X root tasks
Turbo Stream response: <turbo-stream action="update"...
```

## Current Status:

Based on our fixes:
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates are working
- ✅ Server correctly orders tasks by status
- ✅ Server returns Turbo Stream response
- ✅ Client processes Turbo Stream with Turbo.renderStreamMessage()
- ❓ Tasks should now reorder when status changes
