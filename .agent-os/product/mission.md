## The Problem

### Fragmented Information Management

Service teams waste hours daily searching for client details across emails, spreadsheets, and various tools. This leads to 30% productivity loss and frustrated clients who have to repeat information.

**Our Solution:** Centralized client database with all information instantly accessible and automatically tracked.

### Inefficient Task Coordination

Teams struggle with task assignment, priority management, and status visibility. Studies show 40% of service delays come from poor coordination.

**Our Solution:** Real-time task management with drag-and-drop prioritization and instant updates via Zero.js.

### Lack of Accountability

Without proper audit trails, teams can't track who did what and when. This causes 25% of client disputes and compliance issues.

**Our Solution:** Comprehensive activity logging with automatic tracking of all actions and changes.

## Differentiators
