> Spec: Keyboard Navigation for Popovers
> Created: 2025-07-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation for all popover components, removing focus rings and enabling arrow key navigation with consistent highlight behavior across mouse and keyboard interactions.

## User Stories

### Keyboard Power User

As a keyboard power user, I want to navigate popover menus using arrow keys, so that I can efficiently select options without reaching for the mouse.

When I open a popover (like Job Status, Assigned To, or Filter), I should be able to press the up/down arrow keys to highlight menu items. The highlight behavior should match exactly what happens when I hover with the mouse. I can press Space or Return to select an item, and the popover closes immediately upon selection.

### Developer Implementing Popovers

As a developer, I want to optionally add global keyboard shortcuts to popover menu items, so that power users can execute common actions without even opening the popover.

When implementing a popover, I can specify keyboard shortcuts for specific menu items. These shortcuts work globally while the user is on the page, regardless of whether the popover is open. The shortcuts are displayed right-aligned in the menu item for discoverability.

## Spec Scope

1. **Focus Ring Removal** - Eliminate all blue focus rings throughout the application
2. **Arrow Key Navigation** - Enable up/down arrow navigation with wrapping behavior
3. **Keyboard Selection** - Support Space and Return keys for item selection
4. **Global Shortcuts** - Optional developer-defined keyboard shortcuts for menu items
5. **Consistent Highlighting** - Unified highlight behavior for both mouse and keyboard

## Out of Scope

- Horizontal navigation (left/right arrows)
- Multi-level or nested popover navigation
- Tab-based navigation within popovers
- Accessibility features beyond keyboard navigation (screen reader enhancements)
- Mobile touch gestures

## Expected Deliverable

1. All popovers support keyboard navigation with arrow keys, space, and return
2. No focus rings appear anywhere in the application
3. Developers can easily add global keyboard shortcuts to any popover menu item
