# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: New Task Button Refinement
> Created: 2025-07-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Refine the New Task button behavior to provide a more intuitive and visually appealing experience across desktop and mobile devices. The button will adapt its position based on list state, show appropriate hover states on desktop, and maintain visibility on mobile devices while providing clear visual feedback through color changes and icon transitions.

## User Stories

### Empty Task List Experience

As a **service technician**, when I view an empty task list, I want the New Task button positioned at the top where the first task would naturally appear, so that I can immediately start adding tasks without scrolling to the bottom.

The improved experience:
- New Task button appears at the top of the empty list
- Clear visual invitation to add the first task
- Natural flow from top to bottom as tasks are added

### Desktop Hover Interaction

As a **desktop user**, when I hover over the New Task row with existing tasks, I want to see clear visual feedback with the text turning blue and the icon changing, with the label hiding to reduce visual clutter.

The interaction flow:
1. Default state shows "New Task" text in current theme color with plus-circle icon
2. Hovering anywhere in the row triggers:
   - Text color changes to primary blue
   - Icon switches to plus-circle-blue.svg
   - Label hides (when tasks exist) to emphasize the action
3. Visual feedback is immediate without animation delays

### Mobile Touch Experience

As a **mobile user**, I need the New Task label to remain visible at all times for clarity, with color changes providing feedback when I interact with it.

The mobile experience:
- "New Task" label always visible regardless of task list state
- Tapping/pressing shows blue color for both text and icon
- Consistent behavior across all mobile devices
- Touch targets meet accessibility standards

## Spec Scope

1. **Conditional Positioning** - Move New Task button to top when task list is empty
2. **Desktop Hover States** - Hide label on hover when tasks exist, show blue text color
3. **Mobile Persistent Label** - Always show label on mobile devices
4. **Color Transitions** - Default current color to blue on interaction
5. **Icon Switching** - Change to plus-circle-blue.svg on row hover
6. **Responsive Behavior** - Different behaviors for desktop vs mobile via media queries

## Out of Scope

- Changing the overall task list layout or structure
- Modifying task creation workflow or input behavior
- Adding animations or transitions to hover states
- Changing the existing keyboard shortcuts
- Modifying the inline task creation behavior
- Altering the existing plus-circle icon design

## Expected Deliverable

1. New Task button appears at top of empty task lists
2. Desktop users see refined hover states with hiding label (when tasks exist)
3. Mobile users always see the label with color feedback
4. Consistent blue color theme on interaction across all states
5. Icon switches to blue variant on hover without animation
