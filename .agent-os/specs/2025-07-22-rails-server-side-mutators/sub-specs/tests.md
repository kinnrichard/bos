## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**MutationsController**
- JWT token validation rejects invalid tokens
- JWT token validation extracts correct user ID from valid tokens  
- Permission checking prevents unauthorized operations
- Create operations apply all required mutators (positioning, activity logging)
- Update operations track changes correctly and apply appropriate mutators
- Delete operations create proper activity logs with user attribution
- Error handling returns correct HTTP status codes and error messages
- Bulk operations maintain transaction integrity with proper rollback

**ServerSideMutators::CreateMutator**
- Identical positioning algorithm results as client-side equivalent
- Activity logging creates records with server-validated user attribution  
- Field validation matches client-side validation rules exactly
- Normalization produces identical results to client-side normalization
- Business logic execution matches client-side mutator behavior
- Error conditions handled consistently with client-side behavior

**ServerSideMutators::UpdateMutator**
- Change tracking identifies modified fields accurately
- Activity logging reflects actual changes with proper metadata
- Positioning updates maintain consistent ordering with client calculations
- Status change detection matches client-side logic
- User attribution enforcement prevents spoofing attempts
- Optimistic locking conflicts detected and handled properly

**ServerSideMutators::PositioningMutator**
- Mathematical consistency with client-side positioning algorithm
- Scope-based positioning maintains isolation between different contexts
- Concurrent reordering operations produce deterministic results
- Edge cases (first position, last position, gaps) handled identically to client
- Performance optimizations don't affect calculation accuracy

**MutationAuthService** 
- JWT token extraction from request headers works correctly
- Token validation detects expired tokens
- Token validation detects tampered tokens
- User extraction returns correct user object for valid tokens
- Security violations logged with appropriate detail
- Rate limiting prevents abuse attempts

### Integration Tests

**Complete Mutation Workflows**
- End-to-end task creation with positioning and activity logging
- Job status updates with proper change tracking and user attribution
- Task reordering operations produce consistent results across client/server
- Bulk operations maintain data integrity across multiple records
- Delete operations properly cascade and create audit trails
- User permission enforcement across different user roles and operations

**Client-Server Consistency Validation**
- Positioning algorithm produces identical results between client and server
- Activity logging metadata matches between client predictions and server results
- Field normalization behavior consistent across client and server implementations
- Business logic calculations match between optimistic updates and server validation
- Error handling produces consistent behavior between client and server
- Concurrent operations resolved consistently between client and server

**Security Integration**
- Malicious JWT tokens properly rejected with security logging
- User impersonation attempts detected and blocked
- Permission escalation attempts blocked and logged
- Rate limiting prevents mutation spam attacks
- SQL injection attempts in mutation data blocked
- Cross-user data access attempts prevented and logged

**Zero.js Integration**
- Mutations properly sync through Zero.js after server validation
- Real-time updates reflect server-validated results
- Conflict resolution maintains server authority over client predictions
- Offline mutation queue replays correctly through server validation
- WebSocket connections handle server validation errors gracefully

### Feature Tests

**Security Attack Scenarios**
- Modified client attempts user impersonation via context manipulation
- Malicious client sends forged JWT tokens for privilege escalation  
- Compromised client attempts to modify positioning calculations
- Bad actor tries to inject malicious data through mutation parameters
- Client attempts to bypass server validation through direct Zero.js calls
- User attempts operations outside their permission scope

**Mathematical Consistency Scenarios**
- Complex positioning operations across multiple concurrent users
- Activity logging consistency under high-frequency update scenarios
- Bulk operations with mixed success/failure results produce correct state
- Concurrent task reordering produces deterministic final positioning
- Edge case handling (empty lists, single items, boundary conditions) matches client behavior
- Performance stress testing maintains calculation accuracy under load

**Business Logic Compliance** 
- Task creation follows all business rules consistently between client and server
- Job status transitions respect workflow constraints on both client and server
- User assignments validate permissions consistently across client and server
- Field validation rules match exactly between optimistic updates and server validation
- Audit trail completeness maintained under all operation scenarios
- Data integrity maintained across complex multi-step operations

### Mocking Requirements

**JWT Authentication System**
- Mock JWT tokens for different user scenarios (valid, expired, invalid, tampered)
- Mock user permission systems for testing authorization logic
- Mock rate limiting system for testing abuse prevention
- Test with tokens containing various user roles and permission levels

**Zero.js Server Communication**
- Mock Zero.js server responses for testing integration paths
- Simulate Zero.js server failures to test error handling
- Mock WebSocket connections for testing real-time sync behavior
- Test offline/online transitions with mutation queue replay

**Database Transaction Management**
- Mock transaction rollback scenarios for bulk operation testing
- Simulate database constraint violations during mutations
- Mock concurrent access patterns for testing locking behavior
- Test database connection failures during critical operations

**Performance Testing Environment**
- Mock high-frequency mutation scenarios to test server performance
- Simulate network latency between client and server for consistency testing
- Mock concurrent user sessions for testing resource contention
- Load testing framework for validating mutation throughput limits

## Consistency Testing Framework

**Automated Client-Server Verification**
- Automated test suite that runs identical operations on client and server mutators
- Mathematical verification of positioning algorithms across different data sets
- Property-based testing for business logic consistency across random inputs
- Regression testing for previously identified client-server inconsistencies
- Performance benchmarking to ensure server validation doesn't degrade user experience

**Continuous Consistency Monitoring**
- Production monitoring that detects client-server calculation discrepancies
- Alerting system for when consistency checks fail in production
- Automated rollback procedures when server validation detects malicious client behavior
- Metrics collection for mutation validation success/failure rates
- Dashboard showing real-time consistency health across all mutation types
