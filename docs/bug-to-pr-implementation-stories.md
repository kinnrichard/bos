# Bug-to-PR Automation Implementation Stories

Based on the architecture document and our discussions, here's the simplified implementation plan with both bug reports and feature requests.

## Overview

This implementation creates a feedback system that:
- Allows users to report bugs with automatic PR generation via Claude Code
- Allows users to request features with semi-automated story generation
- Places both options in the user menu for easy access
- Requires no rate limiting or complex authorization
- Total estimated time: ~35-45 hours

## Epic 1: Feedback Collection System

### Story 1.1: Create Feedback Models and Menu Integration

**As a** user  
**I want** to report bugs or request features from the user menu  
**So that** I can easily provide feedback to improve the system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create BugReport model with request_type enum (bug/feature)
2. Add dividers and two menu items to UserMenuComponent:
   - üêõ Report a Bug
   - ‚ú® Request a Feature  
3. Position between Settings and Sign Out
4. Create routes and controller for feedback
5. Add all fields from architecture (including metadata JSONB)
6. Include Loggable concern for activity tracking

**Technical Notes:**
- Model fields: user_id, title, description, console_logs, browser_info, page_url, screenshot_data, status, metadata, unique_id, request_type
- Use enum request_type: { bug: 0, feature: 1 }
- Follow existing model patterns

**Estimated:** 3-4 hours

### Story 1.3: Build Feature Request Multi-Step Form

**As a** user requesting a feature  
**I want** to provide detailed information about my needs  
**So that** developers understand what to build

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create FeatureRequestWidget Phlex component
2. Implement 5-screen progressive form with these exact questions:

   **Screen 1: Initial Request**
   - "What would you like to add or improve?" (text field)
   - "How important is this to you?" (radio buttons)
     - Nice to have
     - Would really help my workflow  
     - Critical - blocking my work

   **Screen 2: Problem Definition**
   - "What problem are you trying to solve?" (text area)
   - "How do you handle this today?" (text area)
   - "How often do you face this?" (radio buttons)
     - Daily
     - Weekly  
     - Monthly
     - Occasionally

   **Screen 3: Solution Exploration**
   - "Describe your ideal solution" (text area)
   - "Have you seen this done well elsewhere?" (text area - optional)

   **Screen 4: Context**
   - "What's your main goal with this feature?" (text area)
     - Helper text: "Examples: Save time, reduce errors, automate tasks, better insights"
   - "Expected outcome after implementation?" (text area)
     - Helper text: "What specific improvement do you expect?"

   **Screen 5: Priority & Impact**
   - "Business impact if implemented?" (radio buttons)
     - Minor efficiency gain
     - Significant time savings
     - Unlocks new capabilities
