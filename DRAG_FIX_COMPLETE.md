# Drag Issue Solved! ðŸŽ‰

The drag-and-drop functionality has been completely fixed:

## Issues Fixed:
1. âœ… Tasks losing draggable state after status changes
2. âœ… Tasks losing draggable state after reordering
3. âœ… Click area expanding after drag operations
4. âœ… Task selection working correctly

## Solution:
- Created `Bos.renderTurboStreamMessage` wrapper that automatically refreshes sortable controllers
- All Turbo Stream operations now preserve drag functionality
- DRY approach ensures future Turbo Stream updates won't break dragging

## Testing:
- Confirmed tasks remain draggable after changing status
- Confirmed tasks remain draggable after reordering
- All drag-and-drop operations work smoothly

The drag issue is now completely resolved!
