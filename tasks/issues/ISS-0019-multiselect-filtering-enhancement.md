# Multi-Select Parent Filtering Enhancement

## User Story

**As a** user selecting multiple tasks including parents and children  
**I want** the system to move only the parent tasks automatically  
**So that** I don't accidentally separate children from their parents during multi-select operations

## Problem Statement

The current multi-select logic (Gs exclusion) works correctly but needs enhancement to integrate with the new boundary rules (A, B, C). The system should apply the logical relationship rules to the filtered set of tasks while maintaining performance.

## Solution Overview

Enhance the existing multi-select filtering logic to:
1. Continue filtering out children when parents are selected (Gs exclusion)  
2. Apply Rules A, B, C to the remaining filtered tasks
3. Maintain sequential positioning for multiple tasks
4. Preserve performance for large selections

## Technical Requirements

### Current Implementation Analysis
The existing code already implements Gs exclusion correctly in `TaskList.svelte` (lines 1478-1483):
```javascript
const rootTaskIds = sortedTaskIds.filter(taskId => {
  const task = cleanedKeptTasks.find(t => t.id === taskId);
  return !task?.parent_id || !sortedTaskIds.includes(task.parent_id);
});
```

### Enhancement Requirements
- [ ] Integrate Gs exclusion with new boundary rules (A, B, C)
- [ ] Apply Rules A, B, C to first task in filtered selection
- [ ] Position subsequent tasks sequentially after first task
- [ ] Maintain performance <100ms for up to 100 selected tasks
- [ ] Preserve visual feedback (multi-drag badge, etc.)

### Integration Points
- [ ] Work with new `calculateParentFromBoundaryRules()` function
- [ ] Use `convertRelativeToPositionUpdates()` for batch operations
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with `applyAndExecutePositionUpdates()`

### Filtered View Integration
- [ ] **Logical neighbor discovery**: Multi-select positioning uses complete task list for relationships
- [ ] **Consistent with Rule A**: First task positioning finds actual siblings, not visual neighbors
- [ ] **Filter-aware operations**: Works correctly when some tasks in hierarchy are hidden
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Efficient lookups in complete task list during multi-select

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Acceptance
- [ ] **Gs Exclusion Preserved**: Children are filtered out when parent also selected
- [ ] **First Task Positioning**: First task in filtered selection follows Rules A, B, C
- [ ] **Sequential Positioning**: Subsequent tasks positioned immediately after previous
- [ ] **Selection Order Maintained**: Visual selection order preserved in final positioning
- [ ] **Performance Maintained**: Operations complete <100ms for typical selections

### Multi-Select Scenarios
- [ ] **Parent + Child Selected**: Only parent moves, child follows automatically
- [ ] **Multiple Parents Selected**: Each parent positioned according to rules
- [ ] **Mixed Hierarchy Selected**: Complex selections handled correctly
- [ ] **Large Selections**: Performance maintained with 50+ selected tasks

### Visual Feedback
- [ ] **Multi-drag badge**: Shows correct count of moving tasks
- [ ] **Selection highlighting**: Visual feedback matches actual behavior
- [ ] **Drop indicators**: Clear indication of where tasks will land

## Implementation Details

### Multi-Select Enhancement Checklist

#### Gs Exclusion Logic
- [ ] **Existing logic preserved**: Current filtering continues to work
- [ ] **Parent-child filtering**: Children excluded when parent selected
- [ ] **Performance maintained**: No degradation in multi-select speed
- [ ] **Visual feedback**: Multi-drag badge shows correct count

#### Rules Application
- [ ] **First task rules**: Rules A, B, C applied to first filtered task
- [ ] **Sequential positioning**: Subsequent tasks positioned after first
- [ ] **Selection order preserved**: Visual order maintained in final result
- [ ] **Batch operations**: Uses `convertRelativeToPositionUpdates()` efficiently

### Current Code Integration

#### Existing Multi-Select Logic (Keep)
```javascript
// Lines 1467-1528 in TaskList.svelte - KEEP THIS LOGIC
if (isMultiSelectDrag && taskIdsToMove.length > 1) {
  // Sort tasks by visual order
  const sortedTaskIds = Array.from(taskSelection.selectedTaskIds);
  sortedTaskIds.sort((a, b) => {
    const indexA = flattenedTasks.findIndex(item => item.task.id === a);
    const indexB = flattenedTasks.findIndex(item => item.task.id === b);
    return indexA - indexB;
  });
  
  // Filter root tasks (Gs exclusion) - KEEP THIS
  const rootTaskIds = sortedTaskIds.filter(taskId => {
    const task = cleanedKeptTasks.find(t => t.id === taskId);
    return !task?.parent_id || !sortedTaskIds.includes(task.parent_id);
  });
  
  // ENHANCE: Apply Rules A, B, C to rootTaskIds
}
```

#### Enhancement Pattern
```javascript
rootTaskIds.forEach((taskId, index) => {
  if (index === 0) {
    // ENHANCE: Use Rules A, B, C for first task
    const firstTaskUpdate = calculateRelativePositionWithBoundaryRules(
      event.dropZone, 
      newParentId, 
      rootTaskIds
    );
    relativeUpdates.push(firstTaskUpdate);
  } else {
    // KEEP: Sequential positioning for subsequent tasks
    const previousTaskId = rootTaskIds[index - 1];
    relativeUpdates.push({
      id: taskId,
      parent_id: newParentId,
      after_task_id: previousTaskId
    });
  }
});
```

### Enhanced Implementation Details
```javascript
function enhancedMultiSelectDrop(rootTaskIds, previousItem, nextItem) {
  const relativeUpdates = [];
  
  // Apply Rules A, B, C to first task
  const firstTaskParentId = calculateParentFromBoundaryRules(previousItem, nextItem);
  const firstTaskPosition = calculatePositionFromBoundaryRules(
    previousItem, 
    nextItem, 
    firstTaskParentId
  );
  
  relativeUpdates.push({
    id: rootTaskIds[0],
    parent_id: firstTaskParentId,
    position: firstTaskPosition
  });
  
  // Sequential positioning for remaining tasks
  for (let i = 1; i < rootTaskIds.length; i++) {
    relativeUpdates.push({
      id: rootTaskIds[i],
      parent_id: firstTaskParentId,
      after_task_id: rootTaskIds[i - 1]
    });
  }
  
  return relativeUpdates;
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test Gs exclusion continues to work correctly
- [ ] Test Rules A, B, C applied to first filtered task
- [ ] Test sequential positioning for multiple tasks
- [ ] Test performance with various selection sizes

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test parent-child selections (parent moves, child follows)
- [ ] Test mixed hierarchy selections
- [ ] Test large selections (50+ tasks)
- [ ] Test visual feedback accuracy

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test single task selection (should use Rules A, B, C directly)
- [ ] Test all-children selection (no parents selected)
- [ ] Test circular reference prevention
- [ ] Test invalid selection scenarios

## Performance Requirements

### Benchmarks
- [ ] **Small selections** (2-5 tasks): <50ms
- [ ] **Medium selections** (6-20 tasks): <75ms
- [ ] **Large selections** (21-100 tasks): <100ms
- [ ] **Memory usage**: No significant increase from current implementation

### Optimization Strategies
- [ ] Batch position updates efficiently
- [ ] Minimize DOM queries during drag operations
- [ ] Use efficient sorting and filtering algorithms
- [ ] Cache parent-child relationship lookups

## Implementation Checklist

### Development Environment
- [ ] **Local environment setup**: All dependencies installed and working
- [ ] **Test infrastructure ready**: Unit and integration tests configured
- [ ] **Feature branch created**: Following project naming conventions

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Code review completed**: Peer review and approval
